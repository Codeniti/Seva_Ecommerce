	name="buy-products-earlier-from-my-citypincode-but-my-citypincode-is-shown-as-undeliverable-in-your-system-why"></a>
<h1> I was able to buy products earlier from my city/zipcode, but my city/zipcode is shown as 'undeliverable' in your system. Why?</h1>
	<p>As a process, we constantly look at service levels of our logistics partners and make changes to those areas that do not match our service standards. As a result, there may be certain areas that we do not deliver to, as part of this process. Deliveries to such areas may hence be temporarily affected, before we are able to resume the same.</p>	<br />
